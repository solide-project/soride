## About Soride

Soride is a browser-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed specifically for Soroban smart contract development on the Stellar blockchain. The goal of Soride is to simplify the process of writing, compiling, deploying, and interacting with Soroban contracts without requiring complex local setups and being able to use Soride not just an development tool, but an onboarding tool for better access to Soroban and Stellar blockchain, whilst being able to use Soride to educate and creating a learning environment for everyone.

### Creating, Compiling, and Deploying a Contract

Soride simplifies Soroban smart contract development by allowing users to load contracts directly from GitHub. For example, to work with the token contract from the Soroban example repository, users can navigate to the contractâ€™s root directory and prepend the Soride URL to the GitHub path.

```bash
https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/token
```

To load this contract in Soride, simply use the following URL:

```
https://soroban.polearn.xyz/?url=https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/token
```

Once loaded, the contract can be compiled and deployed seamlessly. In Soroban, deploying a contract requires first uploading the WASM to the Stellar blockchain to generate a WASM Hash, which is necessary for contract deployment.

To deploy a contract, simply click "Deploy New Contract", which allows you to deploy a new instance from the compiled WASM.

Additionally, users can deploy and interact with existing contracts on both Stellar's testnet and mainnet, enabling seamless contract exploration and execution.

### Contract Interaction

Interacting with Soroban contracts in Soride is straightforward. After loading a contract, users can view all available methods. By selecting a method, a popup appears, allowing users to fill in the required parameters for execution.

Users have two interaction options:
- Call â€“ Typically used for view methods to retrieve contract data without modifying the state.
- Send â€“ Used for methods that invoke state changes in the contract.
    
All contract interactions that require wallet authorization are handled through **Freighter**, Stellar's browser wallet extension.

For all user interactions, **Stellar Expert** serves as the blockchain explorer, providing transaction details and verification.

### Utility

As an IDE, Soride is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of tools to support Soroban smart contract development on the Stellar blockchain. To enhance the developer experience, the IDE includes various utilities that simplify contract interactions and streamline development workflows. Currently, Soride offers an ABI tool for extracting and analyzing contract interfaces, as well as a unit conversion tool to assist with on-chain value calculations. These utilities ensure that developers can efficiently interact with and test their Soroban contracts. Additional features and tools will be introduced in future updates following the hackathon to further expand Sorideâ€™s capabilities.

## Whatâ€™s next? How do you plan on continuing to work on the project?

We're working on making Soride even better by adding more tools like ABI utilities, unit conversion, and a transaction decoder, while also speeding up the compilation process for faster builds and making it easier to load verified contracts directly into the IDE. In the future, we plan to introduce a contract marketplace, creating a hub where developers can explore, deploy, and interact with Soroban contracts all in one place.

Beyond development, Soride will be integrated into our educational platform, enabling interactive courses, gamified learning, and developer challenges to onboard users into Soroban.

<img width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solide-project/docs/refs/heads/master/fumadocs/public/soride/soride-course.png" />

Through this we aim to make smart contract development more inclusive and better access for education, ensuring Soride becomes both a powerful IDE and an engaging learning hub for the Stellar ecosystem. Currently, a base for the course is in the [testnet platform](https://edu-test.polearn.xyz/q/polearn/soroban-stellar-smart-contract), but we will be actively creating after the hackathon and using rewards to give back to the community and incentive for completing and learning from the course.

## Getting Started

To run Soride locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository
First, clone the Soride repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/solide-project/soride
```

### Install Dependencies
Navigate into the cloned repository directory and install the required npm packages:
```bash
cd soride
bun install
```

### Install Backend Compiler
Next, install brew and stellar cli and all the backend dependency for interacting with Stellar
```bash
